- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lauren Knill
- 🎮 I'm currently a digital artist and independent programmer looking to work my way into software engineering.
- 📜 I love coding, and have no qualms with writing programming code for hours.
- 🌱 I have beginner college level experience with Java, Python, C++ and HTML
- 💭 I'm currently taking Coursera classes on IT Support and Java OOP to improve and refresh my knowleddge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where you need an entry-level programmer to fill in. I can happily take up tasks such as software testing, documentation, etc.
- 🖥️ I can use Windows, Linux and Apple iOS. I can use Eclipse or Visual Studio, but I would not shy away from teaching myself new vital softwares.
- 📫 You can contact me at laurknill@gmail.com. I am also @Soulsplosion on Twitter and Soulsplosion#5920 on Discord.
- 🫂 I am always interested in networking with likeminded folk, even if you have no projects I can join.
